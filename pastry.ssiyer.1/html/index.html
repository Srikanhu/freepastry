is intended primarily as a tool that allows interested parties to evaluate
Pastry, to perform further research and development in P2P substrates,
and as a platform for the development of applications. Plans for later
releases are to provide a production-strength, fully secure implementation
that is suitable for a full-scale deployment in the Internet.
