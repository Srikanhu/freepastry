This is a testing framework to verify compatability with NATs.  It is based on strongswan's testing environment (http://www.strongswan.org/), but is altered to remove strongswan, and add java/FreePastry/netcat.  The system uses "user mode linux" (UML) to run virtual computers on a single linux box (host).  

Look at desktop_diagram.ppt for the testing scenerio included.

High Level Notes:
  The NATs mars, venus, jupiter are simply UML instances configured with 2 NICs and proper ip-tables rules.
  Note that alice/eve, and bob/fred have identical IP addresses.  
  Pastry binds locally to port 8000
  The nats forward port 9001,9002 to it's 2 internal nodes.
  grace is the bootstrap node
  Testing must be run as root on a linux box
  Better performance can be achieved by installing the SKAS linux patch to the host system.
  The UML instances run under a gentoo distribution.
  
Use:
1) Check out strongswan-testing to /root/strongswan-testing
2) cd /root/strongswan-testing/testing
3) edit start to copy pastry.jar from it's location (currently ~jeffh/planetlab/)
4) ./make-testing
5) screen -r <alice, bob, mars... etc> to log in
  username: root
  password: tuxmux
6) ctrl-a d to switch back to the host computer
7) ./stop to kill the umls and copy out.txt from each computer
8) ./start to copy pastry and run again

Detailed Notes:
testing/hosts/xxx has files copied to the individual nodes when make
testing/hosts/pastry/ is copied to the root directory
use netcat to verify connectivity you expect
ssh to the host coputer via uml0,1,... as needed
eve/fred have trouble sshing to the host via uml3 because the routing on the host will return packets to alice/bob.
we use init.d to run pastry on the end nodes, and iptables on the NATs
/etc/init.d/runpastry calls /root/startpastry on the end nodes.
on every (non-NAT) node except grace, this delays 20 seconds before starting tutorial.lesson3.


Most everything is based on bash scripts.  Good Luck!
