Quick to-dos:  
  Put these on a Wiki (done)
  Forward PR emails. (coming soon to an inbox near you)
  Make sure the protocol_spec is online, send link to everyone: 
  
1)  Do we need SSL?
    Yes, because we want to offer a toolbox of different security features to perspective users.  Different features cost different overhead, but offer protection from different attacks.
        
2)  Note: Even with PR in place there may be possible attacks that do not violate the protocol.  Must review the protocol to make sure such things dont exist.
  Concern that there is an issue with the liveness checks in the RT/CRT.

3) Proposed Cert infrastructure to allow for certs to not have IP address:    
Certs don't contain IP addresses, but have to have a lifetime on the order of 1 day.  (This makes clocks required to be in sync within 1 day)
Have to worry about PNS attack (conspiring nodes can pose as eachother to give good proximity to all their friends), make sure PR can control this, with a rule such as: "You can't accept messages from the older cert."

Open questions:
  Do we need to authenticate liveness checks.

Next steps:
Jeff:       
  Look at bamboo paper to see validity of CRT vs Churn.
  
Atul:
  Determine Churn vs. CRT accuracy and what the maintenance interval should be as a factor of churn.
