 ToDo
------

1. Debug whether the duplication of messages is happening due to RM or RMI/WIRE.
   Set the default protocol to RMI/WIRE depending on the above bug.

2. Distributed Test currently uses the RandomNodeIdFactory. Debug the
   join protocol bug when using IpNodeIdFactory and then use this.
 


Notes
------
