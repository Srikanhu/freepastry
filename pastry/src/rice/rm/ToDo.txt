 ToDo
------

 1. Change the values of SPLITFACTOR and MAXKEYSINRANGE to appropriate values.

 3. Check carefully the best way to handle the m_pendingRanges table in case
    of loss of messages. ( since the protocol is trigger based on the response)
    A loss of a single response may cause it to wait for the entire
    maintenance period. 

 4. During the maintainenance period, what should we do incase the 
    pendingRanges table is not empty.

 8. Set the appropriate value of Maintenance Freq;

 10. Implement the timeout/message mechanism
 
 13. Check if we get duplication of messages in RMI

 14. Set the Distributed Test protocol to RMI/WIRE 


Notes
-----

 
 2. Uses RandomNodeIdFactory in the Distributed test since the IPNodeIDFactory causes problem 
    with the bootstrapping in the join ptotocol
