please note: this package (rice.email.proxy.web) is not maintained, as of 30-Jan-06.

In particular, I'm not changing the ExternalContinuations to ExternalRunnable.

The reason for the change is to try to resolve some synchronization problems by running
Past and Post code on the selector thread.

Here's the output from a perl script giving a flavor of the change:
./rice/email/proxy/web/pages/FolderPage.java:78:          ExternalContinuation d = new ExternalContinuation();
./rice/email/proxy/web/pages/FolderPage.java:79:          real.getHeaders(d);
./rice/email/proxy/web/pages/FolderPage.java:80:          d.sleep();
...
ExternalRunnable d = new ExternalRunnable() {
  protected void run(Continuation d) {
          real.getHeaders(d);
  }
};
d.go(_conn.getEnvironment());
