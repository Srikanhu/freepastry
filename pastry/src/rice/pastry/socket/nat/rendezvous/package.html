This layer maintains temporary information in the NodeHandle for rendezvous nodes.  
Whenever a NodeHandle is deserialized it may contain more current rendezvous information, 
and the call to coalesce() will update this info in the coalesced() NodeHandle.  Note that
the rendezvous list includes a timestamp, and should eventually be signed by the Node.

Extend SRM to use SRStrategy for connecting direct as well. (So can always use the rendezvous if Natted)

Build Planetlab test to simulate NATs 

Don't join if you can't get a rendezvous server.
