General cleanup:

Correctness:

    Leaf set consistency on massive concurrent joins.

Functionality:

    Transparent handle verification, and setLocalHandle.

    Find nearby node algorithm.

Performance:

Security:

    Consider getting rid of the security managers for a while. Or keep them
    around, but actually verify in the verifyHandles, not duplicate or
    coalesce handles, or set local nodes.

When the Socket interface is being implemented:

    Consider moving stuff common to all wire protocols to base. This
    includes significant stuff from RMINodeHandle{,Pool}. Make NodeHandle
    an abstract class (a la PastryNode), rather than an interface.
