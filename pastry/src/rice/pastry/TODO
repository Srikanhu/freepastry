GENERAL CLEANUP

CORRECTNESS

    Leaf set consistency on massive concurrent joins.

FUNCTIONALITY

    Transparent handle verification, and setLocalHandle.

    A real Log class.

PERFORMANCE

    Find-nearby-node algorithm.

SECURITY

    Consider getting rid of the security managers for a while. Or keep them
    around, but actually verify in the verifyHandles, not duplicate or
    coalesce handles, or set local nodes.

APPLICATIONS

    RoundTrip (or HelloWorld with flags) to measure the real latency diff.

LONG-TERM

    When the Socket interface is being implemented:

    Consider moving stuff common to all wire protocols to base. This
    includes significant stuff from RMINodeHandle{,Pool}. Make NodeHandle
    an abstract class (a la PastryNode), rather than an interface.
