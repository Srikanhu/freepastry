DistScribeRegrTest.java [ DISTRIBUTED REGRESSION TEST]
==========================================

Scenario 
--------
We experiment with 5 groups and ask each node to join to each group.
The current root for each group multicasts messages to the group 
with increasing sequence numbers. When a node becomes the root, it
first multicasts some messages with sequence number -1, and then
with increasing sequence numbers. 




Usage
------

$java 	-Djava.security.policy = <your-policy-file> DistScribeRegrTest [-port p] 
	[-bootstrap host[:port]] [-nodes n] [-help]



Expected Output
---------------

1) Each node should receive increasing sequence numbers for each group
after it joins the group and before it leaves the group. Notice that 
it will receive only those messages which were multicast after it 
joined.

2) A node can miss a few sequence numbers (approx. TreeRepairThreshold) 
when its parent dies and before the tree is repaired.

3) When the output doesnt match the expected output, some Warning messages
are printed suggesting the mis-match, for instance 
   a) if lesser sequence number is received, or
   b) if duplicate sequence number is received, suggesting that two or 
      more nodes have this node as their child corresponding to this 
      multicast tree, or
   c) if sequence number received is greater than the (previous sequence
      number received plus the TreeRepairThreshold), suggesting that
      tree repair took longer than expected, or
   d) if it didnt receive any message on a group for a specified period
      even though root was multicasting on that group, suggesting that
      it is probably no longer part of the multicast group, or
   e) if it receives message for a group it has already left








DirectScribeRegrTest.java [ SIMULATION BASED REGRESSION TEST]
=============================================================


This is a comprehensive testing of Scribe funcationalities. You should check
if all the sub-tests were PASSED. The final message tells you whether the 
entire test consisting of several sub-tests PASSED or not.
