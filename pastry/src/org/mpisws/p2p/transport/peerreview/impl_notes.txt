

Differences between CPP/Java:
  
SecureHistory:
  create()/open() come from a factory  
  open() takes a boolean readOnly rather than char[] {"r","w"}
  open() throws an exception if the file doesn't exist on readOnly, rather than retun null
  fwrite(&entry) => SecureHistory.writeEntry()

Notes on the history:
indexFile // contains fixed size objects including where the content starts in Data
  
dataFile 

IndexEntry
  type can be 8-bit
  contentHash = H(full content) 
  nodeHash = H(prevNode.nodeHash, seq, type, contentHash)
  
entry/header may be byte[] or ByteBuffer

NodeHandle, content, sygnature // this is typically the input
