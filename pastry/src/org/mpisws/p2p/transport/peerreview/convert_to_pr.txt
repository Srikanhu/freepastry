  This document is a log of converting the ConsistencyPLTest to PRConsistenctyPLTest, which uses PR to audit the routing state in the presence of splitstream.

* Copy ConsitencyPLTest to PRConsistencyPLTest, and get it running
* Setup PKI:
  java org.mpisws.p2p.pki.x509.CAToolImpl -store

This output's a file called something like:
  84FFD4C9B1449D7B8DD2984CC9511FFBB273BA9C.store, contains the client private-key/cert, and the caCert (to verify other clients)

* Use the CertificateNodeId factory

* Insert IdentityTL/PeerReviewImpl between UpperIdentity and CommonAPI 

* Created PeerReviewCallbackImpl (should be reusable)
