FreePastry is an open-source implementation of <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/Pastry/">Pastry</a>
intended for deployment in the Internet. The initial release of FreePastry
is intended primarily as a tool that allows interested parties to evaluate
Pastry, to perform further research and development in P2P substrates,
and as a platform for the development of applications. Plans for later
releases are to provide a production-strength, fully secure implementation
that is suitable for a full-scale deployment in the Internet.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Release</h3>
Version 1.0 will be released in early 2002 under a BSD-like license. 
<br>
<p>
Update: We are running a bit behind, the release is now planned for
end of March. A pre-alpha release is running stably, both on top of a
simulated network and over the real network. It is being used for
several projects internally. We are working on documentation, cleaning
up the code, redesigning some interfaces, etc.
<p>
UPDATE: Release date is Thu, April 4, 2002. Thanks for your patience!

<br>
<p>
Please stay tuned....
