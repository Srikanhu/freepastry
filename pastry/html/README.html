 Release 0.1 beta, 4/4/02.<br>
 <br>
 This is the first beta release of FreePastry.<br>
 <br>
 FreePastry is a modular, open source implementation of the <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/Systems/Pastry/">
 Pastry</a>
 &nbsp;p2p routing and location substrate. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Contributors</h3>
 Peter Druschel, Y. Charlie Hu, Sitaram Iyer, Andrew Ladd, RongMei Zhang
contributed to the FreePastry code. The code is based on algorithms and protocols
described in the following papers:<br>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
 The software requires a Java runtime, version 1.3. The software was developed 
using Sun's SDK, version 1.3.1.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 
<h3>Limitations</h3>
 <br>
 The initial release has the following limitations.<br>
 <br>
 
<ul>
   <li>The API is still subject to change.</li>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   <li>Documentation is minimal.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
   <li>Virtually no performance tuning of the implementation has been done 
as of yet.<br>
     <br>
   </li>
   <li>Two "wire protocols" are provided with the initial release, "Direct" 
and "RMI".</li>
 
</ul>
 
<ul>
   
  <ul>
     <li>"Direct" emulates a network, allowing many Pastry nodes to execute
in one Java VM without a real network. This is very useful for application 
development and testing.</li>
   
  </ul>
 
</ul>
 
<blockquote></blockquote>
   
  <ul>
     
    <ul>
       <li>RMI is simple wire protocol based on Java RMI. Several "virtual"
Pastry nodes can be started in each Java VM. RMI is used for communication
across physical nodes.</li>
     
    </ul>
   
  </ul>
   
  <blockquote>We will release more efficient wire protocols based on sockets 
later. Future wire protocols will also be based on an open standard to ensure 
interoperability among different implementations.<br>
     <br>
     </blockquote>
     
    <ul>
       <li>Security support does not exist in this release. Therefore, the&nbsp; 
software should only be run in trusted environments. Future release&nbsp; 
will include security.</li>
     
    </ul>
     
    <ul>
      <li>The discovery protocol for automatic location of a nearby node
using any bootstrap node, which is described in the Pastry proximity paper,
is not yet implemented in FreePastry. To allow Pastry to construct an efficient
network proximity-aware overlay, the specified bootstrap node should therefore
be the near the current node in the network, among all existing Pastry nodes
in the overlay.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>(Background: To start a Pastry node, the IP address (and
port number, unless the default port is used) of a "bootstrap" or "contact"
node must be provided. If no such node is provided, and no other Pastry node
runs on the local machine, then FreePastry creates a new overlay network
with itself as the only node. Any node that is already part of the Pastry
node can serve as the bootstrap node.)</blockquote>
      <blockquote></blockquote>
        <br>
Future releases will address efficiency, security, interoperability and will 
provide application components like Scribe, Past, replica management, caching, 
etc.<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       <br>
       
        <h3>Installation</h3>
       <br>
 To use the binary distribution, download the pastry jar file and set the 
Java classpath to include the path of the jar file. This can be done using
the "-cp" command line argument, or by setting the CLASSPATH variable in
your shell environment.<br>
       <br>
 To use the source distribution, you will need to have GNU make installed 
(available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make) on your system. Expand the 
archive (FreePastry-0.1-beta.tgz or FreePastry-0.1-beta.zip) into a directory. 
      Execute "make" in the top level directory, then change to the "classes"
directory to run programs.<br>
        <br>
You may have to provide a Java security policy file with sufficient permissions
to allow FreePastry to contact other nodes. The simplest way to do this is
to install a ".java.policy" file with the following content into your home
directory:<br>
        <br>
grant {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission java.security.AllPermission;<br>
};<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
       <br>
        <h3>Running FreePastry</h3>
To run a HelloWorld example with the RMI wire protocols:<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.RMIHelloWorld
[-msgs m] [-port p] [-nodes n] [-bootstrap host[:port]] [-help]<br>
        <br>
        <br>
To run a regression test that constructs 500 nodes connected by an emulated
network:<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.DirectPastryRegrTest<br>
        <br>
        <br>
To run a simple performance test based on an emulated network with 500 nodes:<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.DirectPastryPingTest<br>
        <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
        <h3>Writing application on top of FreePastry</h3>
All applications must extend the class rice.pastry.client.PastryAppl. This
class implements the Pastry API. Example applications and drivers can be
found in rice.pastry.testing.<br>
