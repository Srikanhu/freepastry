<h3>
Requirements</h3>
The software requires a Java runtime, version 1.3. The software was developed
using Sun's SDK, version 1.3.1.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Limitations</h3>
The initial release has the following limitations.
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The API is still subject to change.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Documentation is minimal.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Virtually no performance tuning of the implementation has been done as
of yet.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
Two "wire protocols" are provided with the initial release, "Direct" and
"RMI".</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
"Direct" emulates a network, allowing many Pastry nodes to execute in one
Java VM without a real network. This is very useful for application development
and testing.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
RMI is simple wire protocol based on Java RMI. Several "virtual" Pastry
nodes can be started in each Java VM. RMI is used for communication across
physical nodes.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<blockquote>We will release more efficient wire protocols based on sockets
later. Future wire protocols will also be based on an open standard to
ensure interoperability among different implementations.</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>
Security support does not exist in this release. Therefore, the&nbsp; software
should only be run in trusted environments. Future release&nbsp; will include
security.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The discovery protocol for automatic location of a nearby node using any
bootstrap node, which is described in the Pastry proximity paper, is not
yet implemented in FreePastry. To allow Pastry to construct an efficient
network proximity-aware overlay, the specified bootstrap node should therefore
be
the near the current node in the network, among all existing Pastry nodes
in the overlay.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>(Background: To start a Pastry node, the IP address (and port
number, unless the default port is used) of a "bootstrap" or "contact"
node must be provided. If no such node is provided, and no other Pastry
node runs on the local machine, then FreePastry creates a new overlay network
with itself as the only node. Any node that is already part of the Pastry
node can serve as the bootstrap node.)</blockquote>

<p><br>Future releases will address efficiency, security, interoperability
and will provide application components like Scribe, Past, replica management,
caching, etc.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Installation</h3>
To use the binary distribution, download the pastry jar file and set the
Java classpath to include the path of the jar file. This can be done using
the "-cp" command line argument, or by setting the CLASSPATH variable in
your shell environment.
<p>To use the source distribution, you will need to have GNU make installed
(available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make) on your system. Expand
the archive (FreePastry-0.1-beta.tgz or FreePastry-0.1-beta.zip) into a
directory. Execute "make" in the top level directory, then change to the
"classes" directory to run programs.
<p>You may have to provide a Java security policy file with sufficient
permissions to allow FreePastry to contact other nodes. The simplest way
to do this is to install a ".java.policy" file with the following content
into your home directory:
<p>grant {
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; permission java.security.AllPermission;
<br>};

<h3>
Running FreePastry</h3>
1. To run a HelloWorld example with the RMI wire protocol:
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage: java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.RMIHelloWorld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [-port p] [-nodes n] [-bootstrap bshost[:bsport]]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [-verbose|-silent|-verbosity v] [-help]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ports p and bsport refer to RMI registry port numbers (default = 5009).
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without -bootstrap bshost[:bsport], only localhost:p is used for bootstrap.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default verbosity is 5, -verbose is 10, and -silent is -1 (error msgs only).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (replace "pastry.jar" by "FreePastry-&lt;version&gt;.jar", of course)</b></pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some interesting configurations:
<pre><b>
        a. java rice.pastry.testing.RMIHelloWorld

                Starts a standalone Pastry network, and sends two messages
                essentially to itself. Waits for anyone to connect to it,
                so terminate with ^C.

        b. ..RMIHelloWorld -nodes 2

                One node starts a Pastry network, and sends two messages to
                random destination addresses. At some point another node
                joins in, synchronizes their leaf sets and route sets, and
                sends two messages to random destinations. These may be
                delivered to either node with equal probability. Note how
                the sender node gets an "enroute" upcall from Pastry before
                forwarding the message.

        c. ..RMIHelloWorld -nodes 2 -verbose

                Also prints some interesting RMI-level messages.

        d. pokey$ ..RMIHelloWorld
           gamma$ ..RMIHelloWorld -bootstrap pokey

                Two machines coordinate to form a Pastry network.

        e. pokey$ ..RMIHelloWorld
           gamma$ ..RMIHelloWorld -bootstrap pokey
                wait a few seconds, and interrupt with &lt;ctrl-C&gt;
           gamma$ ..RMIHelloWorld -bootstrap pokey

                The second client restarts with a new NodeID, and joins the
                Pastry network. One of them sends messages to the now-dead
                node, finds it down, and <em>may or may not</em> remove it
                from the leaf sets. (repeat a few times to observe both
                possibilities, i.e., leaf sets of size 3 or 5). If the
                latter, then leaf set maintenance kicks in within a minute
                on one of the nodes, and removes the stale entries.

        f. pokey$ ..RMIHelloWorld
           gamma$ ..RMIHelloWorld -bootstrap pokey -nodes 2

                The client on gamma instantiates two virtual nodes, which
                are independent in identity and functionality. Try starting
                say 10 or 30 virtual nodes, killing with a &lt;ctrl-C&gt;,
                starting another bunch, etc.
</b></pre>
<!--
	g. pokey$ RMIHelloWorld -nodes 50 | tee log.pokey
		(allow a minutes or two)
	   gamma$ RMIHelloWorld -bootstrap pokey -nodes 50 | tee log.gamma

		It is possible, though a little tedious, to see how Pastry's
		locality properties hold. Start two groups of 50 virtual
		nodes on two geographically distant hosts.  
-->
<hr width="50%">
<p>2. To run the same HelloWorld application on an emulated network:
<pre><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usage: java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.HelloWorld
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                   [-msgs m] [-nodes n] [-verbose|-silent|-verbosity v]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [-simultaneous_joins] [-simultaneous_msgs] [-help]</b></pre>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some interesting configurations:
<pre><b>
        a. java rice.pastry.testing.HelloWorld

                Creates three nodes, and sends total three messages from
                randomly chosen nodes to random destinations addresses
                (which are delivered to the node with the numerically
                closest address).

        b. ..HelloWorld -simultaneous_joins -simultaneous_msgs

                Join all three nodes at once, then issue three messages,
                then go about delivering them.</b></pre>
<hr width="50%">
<p>3. To run a regression test that constructs 500 nodes connected by an
emulated network:
<pre><b>
        java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.DirectPastryRegrTest
</b></pre>
<hr width="50%">
<p>4. To run a simple performance test based on an emulated network with
500 nodes:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; java [-cp pastry.jar] rice.pastry.testing.DirectPastryPingTest
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Writing applications on top of FreePastry</h3>
All applications must extend the class rice.pastry.client.PastryAppl. This
class implements the Pastry API. Example applications and drivers can be
found in rice.pastry.testing; the Hello World suite (HelloWorldApp.java,
HelloWorld.java, RMIHelloWorld.java) may be a good starting point.
